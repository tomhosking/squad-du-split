She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyonc\u00e9's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \"Crazy in Love\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyonc\u00e9 her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and the top-five songs \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"'s success in the US helped Beyonc\u00e9 attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \"Sweet Dreams\", and singles \"Diva\", \"Ego\", \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" and \"Video Phone\". The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's \"You Belong with Me\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyonc\u00e9 improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech.

Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 36, "text": "April 26, 1864"}], "id": "5734161dd058e614000b690e", "question": "When was the Montana Territory formed?"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 369, "text": "1862"}], "id": "5734161dd058e614000b690f", "question": "When was the first formal school on record?"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 696, "text": "$1.75"}], "id": "5734161dd058e614000b6910", "question": "How much were students charged per week?"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1044, "text": "1886"}], "id": "5734161dd058e614000b6911", "question": "When did the first public school in Virginia City formed?"}]}, {"context": "Montana contains thousands of named rivers and creeks, 450 miles (720 km) of which are known for \"blue-ribbon\" trout fishing.

More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, \"if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics\". The term 'antibiosis', meaning \"against life\", was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis. These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by Selman Waksman, an American microbiologist, in 1942. Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s. Ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host.

Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven's 7th symphony. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's Hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme.

They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis.

This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade.

The Chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army's supply wagons. The Tibetans required Chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement.

Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing.

This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage.

Nagarjuna's school of thought is known as the M\u0101dhyamaka. Some of the writings attributed to Nagarjuna made explicit references to Mahayana texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the agamas.

The planned closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza was cancelled and instead, a ceremony was held at San Francisco International Airport, where the torch was to leave for Buenos Aires. The route changes allowed the run to avoid large numbers of China supporters and protesters against China. As people found out there would be no closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza, there were angry reactions. One demonstrator was quoted as saying that the route changes were an effort to \"thwart any organized protest that had been planned.\" San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, a critic of Mayor Gavin Newsom, said that it was a \"cynical plan to please the Bush State Department and the Chinese government because of the incredible influence of money.\" Newsom, on the other hand, said he felt it was in \"everyone's best interest\" and that he believed people had been \"afforded the right to protest and support the torch\" despite the route changes. Peter Ueberroth, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, praised the route changes, saying, \"The city of San Francisco, from a global perspective, will be applauded.\" People who saw the torch were surprised and cheered as shown from live video of CBS and NBC. The cost to the city for hosting the event was reported to be USD $726,400, nearly half of which has been recovered by private fundraising.
